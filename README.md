# Estimating Global Zooplankton Biomass With a Generalised Linear Mixed Model
This repository contains generalised linear mixed models to estimate the global distribution of zooplankton biomass. This work is supervised by Dr Anthony Richardson and is a research project within my Masters in Quantitative Biology. 

This is an extension of the work by Jason Everett (Heneghan et al.,2020). The tidied COPEPOD dataset (O'Brien 2014) used in this analysis can be found in the Data/ folder. This data was generated as part of work by Heneghan et al. (2020). Further information about the process is available from the lead authors of that paper.
